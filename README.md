# sentiment-analysis-of-airline-news-articles

# Project Overview

This project utilizes the New York Times API to extract sentiment scores from articles related to American, Delta, Southwest, Spirit, and United Airlines published between 2020 and 2022. These sentiment scores are then aggregated and stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

Additionally, the project includes a Tableau visualization that illustrates the correlation between the number of articles published and the sentiment polarity across the selected airline companies. By analyzing this data, insights can be gained into public perception and media coverage trends surrounding these airlines over the specified time period.

Through this project, I aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how media sentiment towards these airlines has evolved over time, and to explore potential correlations between media coverage and public sentiment.
